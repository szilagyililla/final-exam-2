# 💻 Programming Course Manager — Create & Manage Coding Courses

**Description:**
An application to manage programming courses, where new courses can be added to the database, displayed on the frontend, and managed by users.

---

## 1⃣️ Backend Setup

- Create a new project and a cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).
- Set up an **MVC** folder structure for your backend.
- Store sensitive data like MongoDB URI and port number in a `.env` file.
- Create a `Course` model with the following fields:
  `title`, `category`, `instructor`, `price` (EUR), `duration` (h), `level` , `isOnline`, `available`, `createdAt`(Date), `updatedAt`(Date).
- Connect your backend to MongoDB using Mongoose.

---

## 2⃣️ CRUD & Postman

- Following the **MVC pattern**, create:

  - Routes for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.
  - Controllers containing the logic for each route.

- Test your routes with **Postman**:

  - Test creating, fetching, updating, and deleting courses.
  - After successful tests, delete all documents and insert the following 8 course documents:

## 3⃣️ Frontend Setup

- Initialize your React project with **Vite**, clean up starter files.
- Install **TailwindCSS**, or basic CSS for layout.
- Create **3 routes**:

  - `HomePage` — list of available courses.
  - `CreatePage` — form to add new courses.
  - `CoursePage` — detailed view for a single course.

- Create reusable component `CourseCard` to display individual course information.
- Add a **Navbar** with links to `HomePage` and `CreatePage`.

---

## 4⃣️ HomePage

- Display a centered **Programming Courses** title.
- Display courses sorted by **price**, from cheapest to most expensive.
- In a separated section show only courses where `available` is `true`.
- in new section display the most expensive `Intermediate` course .

---

## 5⃣️ CreatePage

- Add a form to submit new courses to the database.
- After a successful creation the app navigates the user to the `HomePage`

---

## 6⃣️ CoursePage & Card Updates

- Each `CourseCard` should have:

  - A **View Details** button navigating to `CoursePage`.
  - A **Delete** button removing the course from the database and updating `HomePage`.
